# Empty Formalism

Source: Brian Eno in conversation with Thomas Oberender [Berliner Festspiele](https://blog.berlinerfestspiele.de/empty-formalism/)

[Brian Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno) is an English composer and visual artist best known for his pioneering work in ambient music. A self-described "non-musician", Eno has helped introduce unique conceptual approaches and recording techniques to contemporary music.

Together with [Peter Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmidt_(artist)), a painter and pioneering multimedia artist, he developed the [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies), a card-based method for promoting creativity. Each card offers a challenging constraint intended to help artists (particularly musicians) break creative blocks by encouraging [lateral thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking).

Brian Eno wanted to study at another art school initially, but then ended up at the Ipswich Art School (1964), which was at this time led by [Roy Ascott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Ascott). The radical new curriculum introduced by Roy Ascott only lasted the two years Brian Eno studied there. One project in the program was deviding the 36 students in 18 pairs, who had to invent a game or challenge, that every other student had to go though. Afterwards, the groups had to write a report on all the other's characters. The rest of the semester, the students had to be the opposite of their character.

Brian Eno argued, that the value of art is always a conferred value. An example for this is the American artist [J. S. G. Boggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._S._G._Boggs) best known for his hand-drawn depictions of banknotes.

A big topic for Eno's artworks is [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics).
