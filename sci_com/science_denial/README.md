## Notes on "How to Talk to a Science Denier" by Lee McIntyre

[Watch on YT](https://youtu.be/hgngoSqGqQ4)

[Lee McIntyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_McIntyre) wrote about the nature of scientific knowledge generation and validation.


    You cannot convince someone with evidence, who doesn't belive in evidence.

In older studies the Backfire Effect was *observed*, meaning that people confronted with evidence hold their wrong believs even stronger afterwords. It was shown, that this effect does occur only in very special cases or not at all. 

Talking to scince deniers therefore never makes things worse - the worst thing to do is not talking to science deniers at all.

First empirical evidence that one can fight back against science deniers and how to do it:
