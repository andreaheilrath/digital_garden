# Science Denial

Science [Denialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism) is popping up in various social classes regarding different topics: climate change, the coronavirus and vaccines, evolution, medicine (homeopathy, quantum healing and other alternative medicine), and many other. It is often interwoven with conspiracy theories and pseudo sciences.

> How to effectively respond to science denialism, however, is an issue that scientists and science advocates are still grappling with. In general not responding to denialism does more harm than good. Allowing false scientific claims, no matter how absurd, to float unchallenged by evidence or logic, is worse than engaging with them. [1]


## How to Talk to a Science Denier

I will try to summarize statements from Gleb Tsipursky (see How to Talk to a Science Denier without Arguing in Artcles) and Lee McIntyre (see How to Talk to a Science Denier in Videos).


### It is possible to fight back

    You cannot convince someone with evidence, who doesn't belive in evidence.

In older studies the Backfire Effect was 'observed', meaning that people confronted with evidence hold their wrong believs even stronger afterwords. It was shown that this effect does occur only in very special cases or not at all. 

**Talking to scince deniers therefore never makes things worse - the worst thing to do is not talking to science deniers at all.**

First empirical evidence that one can fight back against science deniers and how to do it was published by Schmidt & Betsch in 2019, see reference \[2].
As argued in the paper, there are two major ways: topic rebuttal & technique rebuttal.


To debunk misinformation, it is not necessary to be an expert in the field. Knowing and showing the techniques of science denial can help (technique rebuttal). 

Using the techniques can only mitigate disinformation, they cannot overturn it. Once people are exposed to (mis)information, one cannot undo it. 

    Best thing: not allow the science denier to spread their information. 

Example: If you're invited to have a public discussion with a science denier: if it will be cancelled when you go - don't- if it isn't - go!

It's not only about the hard-core leading scince deniers, it's about (their) audience.

### Techniques of Denialism

[Denialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism) mainly based onf five techniques:
* Fake Experts
* Logical Fallacies
* Impossible Expectations
* Cherry Picking Evidence
* Conspiracy Theories

A nice overview can be found in reference \[3] and in this course about Science Denial from Columbia College [online](https://columbiacollege-ca.libguides.com/c.php?g=718457&p=5130008)

All anecdotal references McIntyre had, showed that to change their mind, personal interaction and trust are essential.

Beliefs are often not based on evidence, but go with intentity, religion, ...
