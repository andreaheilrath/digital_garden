# Science Denial

## How to Talk to a Science Denier

[Lee McIntyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_McIntyre) wrote about the nature of scientific knowledge generation and validation. A new book will be published in August 2021, with the title *How to Talk to a Science Denier*. I found a video, where Lee McIntyre talks about his book. Here I collect some info from this talk. [Watch on YT](https://youtu.be/hgngoSqGqQ4)

### Some Basics

    You cannot convince someone with evidence, who doesn't belive in evidence.

In older studies the Backfire Effect was 'observed', meaning that people confronted with evidence hold their wrong believs even stronger afterwords. It was shown that this effect does occur only in very special cases or not at all. 

**Talking to scince deniers therefore never makes things worse - the worst thing to do is not talking to science deniers at all.**

First empirical evidence that one can fight back against science deniers and how to do it was published by Schmidt & Betsch in 2019, see reference \[1].
As argued in the paper, there are two major ways: topic rebuttal & technique rebuttal.

[Denialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism) mainly based onf five techniques:
* Fake Experts
* Logical Fallacies
* Impossible Expectations
* Cherry Picking Evidence
* Conspiracy Theories

A nice overview can be found in reference \[2]

To debunk misinformation, it is not necessary to be an expert in the field. Knowing and showing the techniques of science denial can help (technique rebuttel).

Using the techniques can only mitigate disinformation, they cannot overturn it. Once people are exposed to (mis)information, one cannot undo it. 

Best thing: not allow the science denier to spread their information. 

Example: If you're invited to have a public discussion with a science denier: if it will be cancelled when you go - don't- if it isn't - go!

It's not only about the hard-core leading scince deniers, it's about (their) audience.
