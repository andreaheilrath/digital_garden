# (Self) Management

## Time-Management

**Time is the most valuable resource.**

Different time horizons: long-term (months/years) / mid-term (month/s) / short-term (days/weeks)

### Prioritization

First collect all tasks, and then evaluate them according to
- cost
- impact
- urgency

### Motivating Goals

**No focus without a target.**

Bad goals: too big, no deadline, wrong goals.\
Two types:
- What? -> [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
- How? -> What state of mind & body?

minimum target / realisitic target / dream target

Tools: Done-List, Success Diary, Reward List, Success Team

### Weekly Schedule

- Gather all tasks and events (also private!)
- Put a time estimate for each task
- Fill your week with tasks
- 20-30% time buffer!!!
- Sundays are off
- Define 3 goals for the week + one mini-goal
- Beware of YOUR goals!
- Work on important things first, not on the most urgent
- Evaluate the time you actually needed for each task

Other tips
- Batch similar tasks
- Use time tracking (Toggl)
- Use tools like Pomorodo or Focus Apps (Forest)



### Milestones

Break large tasks down to small bites.\
Set dates earlyer, so you still have a time buffer.\
Find an accountability buddy.

### Keep on going ...

15 Minutes every day for YOUR task.\
Take days off!!\

### Delegate

How important is something? Who could do it? 
How much time does it cost to delegate it vs. doing it myself? 
Can someone else explain the task? 
Is it good to have a guidline for this task?

Make the task clear. Set a deadline. Find the right person. Talk about the process.
Have time for feedback and corrections. Support the person. Communicate the team that he/she has the responsibility for the task.
Appreciate their work!!
