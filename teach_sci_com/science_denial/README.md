# Science Denial

Science [Denialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism) is popping up in various social classes regarding different topics: climate change, the coronavirus and vaccines, evolution, medicine (homeopathy, quantum healing and other alternative medicine), and many other. It is often interwoven with conspiracy theories and pseudo sciences.

> How to effectively respond to science denialism, however, is an issue that scientists and science advocates are still grappling with. In general not responding to denialism does more harm than good. Allowing false scientific claims, no matter how absurd, to float unchallenged by evidence or logic, is worse than engaging with them. [P1]


## How to Talk to a Science Denier

In this article I summarize stements from Gleb Tsipursky (see \[A1]) and Lee McIntyre (see \[V1]).


### Adjust Expectations

> You cannot convince someone with evidence, who doesn't belive in evidence. *Lee McIntyre \[V1]*

Existing belive systems are often stronger than evidence. Due to the confirmation bias we tend to look for and interpret information in ways that conforms to our beliefs.

In general, we need empathy to understand the other people’s emotions, to determine what emotional blocks might cause them to keep their irrational believe system.
The key to convincing someone is trust!

### Building Trust Before Sharing Information

The Method Gleb Tsipurski describes in is article *EGRIP* is short for Emotions, (Shared) Goals, Rapport, Information and Positive Reinforcement.

Therefore, after understanding the persons emotions / fears, it's important to talk about shared goals, which creates a common ground. Rapport means reflecting the other persons' view that one understood through empathic listening. After that, one can share some (scientific) information about the topic and reinforce the positive change in the other persons' thinking.


### Methods of Rebuttal

In older studies the Backfire Effect was 'observed', meaning that people confronted with evidence hold their wrong believs even stronger afterwords. It was shown that this effect does occur only in very special cases or not at all. **Therefore, talking to scince deniers never makes things worse - the worst thing to do is not talking to science deniers at all.**

First empirical evidence that one can fight back against science deniers and how to do it was published by Schmidt & Betsch in 2019, see reference \[2].
As argued in the paper, there are two ways: topic rebuttal & technique rebuttal.

### Technique Rebuttal
To debunk misinformation, it is not necessary to be an expert in the field. Knowing and showing the techniques of science denial can help.
Therefore it is important to know the main techniques of science denialsim. A nice overview can be found in reference \[3] and in this course about Science Denial from Columbia College [online](https://columbiacollege-ca.libguides.com/c.php?g=718457&p=5130008)

**Denialism mainly based onf five techniques:**

* Fake Experts
* Logical Fallacies
* Impossible Expectations
* Cherry Picking Evidence
* Conspiracy Theories


### Content Rebuttal

When you know something about the field, you can provide some scientific information and debunk the misinformation


## Misinfomation Cannot be Undone

Using the techniques can only mitigate disinformation, they cannot overturn it. Once people are exposed to (mis)information, one cannot undo it.

The best thing is not allow the science denier to spread their information.

Example: If you're invited to have a public discussion with a science denier: if it will be cancelled when you go - don't- if it isn't - go!

It's not only about the hard-core leading scince deniers, it's about (their) audience.
