# GLSL Shaders

I frequently run GLSL Shaders on Raspberry Pis.

This can easly be done with the [GLSLViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer)

I have my onw collection [here]().

Unfortunately the graphics chip on the PI4 changed, so GLSLViewer is only working for Raspberry Pi 3 and lower.

Another interesting thing is [this](https://github.com/astefanutti/kms-glsl).
